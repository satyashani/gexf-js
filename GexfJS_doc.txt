Method summary - GexfJS.<method>
	init(conf) - picks up divs, adds canvas elements to them, adds events, cleans map and
		if graphFile is set in conf, loads and draws it.
	zoomin,zoomout,toggleLens,toggleEdge - events for control tools
	addCanvas,addevents - add these to DOM
	initMap()  - clean up canvas and reset slider and canvas sizes
	loadAndDrawGraph(url) - loads a graphs, if url is supplied it is used, else GexfJS.p.graphFile
		is used which can be set like GexfJS.setConf({'graphFile':<fileurl>}). It parses and
		draws the graph on success because graph drawing should start only when file loading completes.
	parseGraph(data) - parses gexf file data and loads GexfJS.graph  with elements found. Draws graph.
	draw()	- draws the graph that is stored in GexfJS.graph.
	traceArc,traceMini,traceMap - actually draw the graph
	mapGraph(url) - loads and draws the map from passed url.
	mapFromLink() - used to extract url of links on clicking them and call mapGraph,
		used like $('.gexflink').click(GexfJS.mapFromLink)
Note -
	1. id of zoom/lens/edge control elements are hardcoded
	2. in graphs having no position data for nodes, random positions are provided at present
	3. currently graph is drawn on certain events which change state. In original script graph was drawn
	   at 60 millisecond interval which had made the script slow for large graphs.
	4. For better performance, a queue must be implemented that draws the graph in steps.

**********FRLayout.js************
FRLayout - Implements a layou algo. To layout the nodes - do FR.start(). It acts on GexfJS object,
            so depends on Gexf.js and graph object loaded. No checking is done at present.
